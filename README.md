The assets for the Vitris homepage website found at https://tryvitris.com

We're frequently asked whether we use our content management system for our own website. For a while the answer was no, however we recently updated our blog to utilize the Vitris CMS. Our rational is strong in our opinion for not fully using our app for our own website; our website is the "guinea pig" for additional features (mostly in the backend) that we'd like to roll out for merchant's websites. Think of this as our race team project, honing our skills and mastering complex features before releasing them in the wild.

## Priorities

  ### Small Business Categories
  Building out each industry specific page that not only includes all the benefits for utilizing our platform for their specific industry but also real results we've seen with merchants using Vitris in that industry.

## Research

This is a good, centralized location to post all our research related to web development as it relates to customer facing websites. Eventually we should develop a standarized format, that comes with time.

  ### Analytics

  #### User Timing
  We should be able to accurately track "in the wild" how quickly our assets are loading on each clients device. This will allow us to prioritize different optimizations of asset deliveries.

  #### URL Building & Tracking
  Google's built an open source url builder. Would be nice to eventually build it into the Vitris app, must be more user friendly.

  ### Interfacing
  The modern web is designed with interfacing applications together and this will be the trend going forward until we have full connectivity. Deploying as much connectivity as possible will increase digital conversion rates.
  
  #### HTML Markup
